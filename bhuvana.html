             year ending exams. I am the only one who got 10.0 points and highest marks i.e., 
             971 out of 1000 for entire M.P.C. in my campus.
              I prepared for JEE mains and qualified in that exam. 
             But unfortunately I neither get into NITs nor IITs. 
             So I decided to work hard for EAMCET.My Mathematics lecturer Mr.A.Appala Naidu sir helped me 
             lot in understanding Mathematics concepts even during the lockdown. 
             His constant support,encouragement,trust helped me in getting good rank in A.P. EAMCET.
             I was really thankful for his constant support.
